How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
Dear 4YF Capital,

After discussing with our BOD and the Backers (Elofun Studio), we cant not refund 100% the investment. The fund has been used for the development of the game and at the moment we can only refund 50% (˜12k5 USD). 4FY is still in the investor list of Drapia so Drapia’s Branding will not be affected and the risk for 4FY is reduced by half. We believe this is a win-win solution for both parties.


 1. What is the timeline and order of events? INO? IDO?
 ⁃ 21 Feb: Mini Game Windy Challenge will be opened to public for Top Leaderboard.
 ⁃ 26 Feb: Close the leaderboard, people get whitelisted will join in INO
 ⁃ Mid of March: IDO
 ⁃ End of March: The NFT buyers can play the 1st P&E Game Module.
 ⁃ Next April/May, each month there will be one game module released for NFT holder to play. 
 2. What launchpads?
 ⁃ The INO will be held on Drapia Marketplace, Babylons and NFTb
 ⁃ The IDO will be held with Oxbull, NFTb and one more launchpad (Babylons, Duckstarter is ready)
 3. How much is needed still to be raised?
 ⁃ With the new tokenomics, around 0.7M is need to be raised in private round.
 ⁃ 4. What is the value for anyone to buy the NFT?  And value to hold tokens?
There will be 5000 boxes sale via INO (equivalent 15000 NFT). NFT holder will have a chance to play 03 game modules before the alpha game release. In this phase, no breeding function hence there is only 15000 Dragons.

In the alpha game, with breeding function, there will be more NFT in the market.

For the DMV token holder:
 ⁃ Voting
 ⁃ Staking to receive in-game items or RAPI token (in-game token)
 ⁃ Pay fee in module games, alpha game

As you see, all of this are shits!
